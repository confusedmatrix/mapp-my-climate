<p>Mapp My Climate is a web application which enables people to find climate data based on their location. Starting with UK data, the application will be expanded to encompass weather, climatic change and extreme weather events from around the world.</p>

<p>Providing three main data sets mapped according to the user's location, Mapp My Climate shows meterological information dating back over the last 100 years. The app automatically finds the user's location through GPS settings for mobile users, and includes post code entry to select alternative locations or for desktop users. Weather data includes monthly temperatures highs and lows, rainfall levels, air frost days and the number of hours of sunshine per location. Integration with weather forecast data is planned for future development of this aspect of Mapp My Climate.</p>

<p>In addition to enabling users to view recent and historic weather data, extreme weather events are displayed on the 'Climate Events' view. By varying the time slider, users can see the increasing frequency of extreme weather occurances across the UK mapped to locations and click them for more detail. Future versions of the app will enable users to add their own images and videos to the map, creating a user generated database of extreme weather events in the world.</p>

<p>The final view for app launch is the 'Climate Change' screen. This section of Mapp My Climate shows the change in average temperatures across the UK over time, grouped by decades. Including landmark dates to provide context to the changing temperatures and increasing extremes in seasons, this section aims to increase awareness of the speed at which change is being effected in the world and therefore the importance to act to mitigate the effects climate change will have on the planet.</p>
